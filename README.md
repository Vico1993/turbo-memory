# Turbo-Memory

Super named proposed by **GitHub**?!
The plan with this repo is to build a bot that can help me manage my assets.
Instead of me making a Spreadsheet with my expense, maybe with a bot, this can be easier.
Track this for a few months... and see what can happen from there

Will be using telegram for the primary channel

## Setup

1. Need a telegram bot, look at the great telegram [documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots)

2. Create a `.env` file with these keys:

```bash
# Bot token given by the @BotFather
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<TELEGRAM_BOT>

# Used by the bot to know which chat to interact with
TELEGRAM_USER_CHAT_ID=<CHAT_ID>
```
